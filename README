ac2rpt 

This program generate donation receipt for each donor out of two reports from
AccountEdge. The two reports are Bank Register and Card Transactions.
The receipts will be in excel format. This program was modified and rewrite from csv2ofx by
Dennis Muhlestein, Dave (Davestechshop.net) and Arthur Liu

1. Generate Card Transaction in AccountEdge: Reports -> Index to Reports -> Card File -> 
Card Transactions -> Display -> Customize -> Enter the time range, select Receipts in 
Source Journal -> then in Report Fields, also select Address 1 -> Display -> Send -> 
Comma-Separated Text File -> Choose folder and change the file name accordingly. 
If you have foreign receipt, make sure the currency symbol is in letter, such as 
Chinese Yuan, the symbol is ￥，however you should use RMB instead, this is because 
accountEdge or the system cannot handle the currency symbol well.

2. Generate Bank Register in AccountEdge: Reports -> Banking -> Bank Register ->  
Enter the time range -> Display -> Customize -> then in Report Fileds, also select Payment 
Method and Note ->Display -> Send -> Comma-Separated Text File -> Choose folder and change 
the file name accordingly.  

Installation:

To install the program in your site packages, you can use
python to execute the install function:

> python setup.py install

This should work on both Windows, Mac and Linux.

Runtime dependencies:

  wxPython.


Custom Mappings:

    ac2rpt gives preference to custom mappings over the built in mappings.
The builtin mappings (src/ac2rpt/mappings.py can be used as a template
for custom mappings.  You may copy the mappings.py file to your home
directory as ac2rpt_custom.py.  The file may also be placed in the current
working directory.  After creating a copy of the file, add or change the mappings
to suite your needs.  See mappings.py for mapping documentation.

AccountEdge: Check number is necesory in the receipt, it need to be entered at
the Notes below the Check number field.

Enjoy!
